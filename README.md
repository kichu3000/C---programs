# C - Programs

This repository contains various C programs that I have written for practice.  
The programs cover topics such as:

- Data Structures (Stack, Queue, HashSet)
- Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Selection Sort)
- Expression Evaluation (Infix to Postfix, Postfix Evaluation)
- Frequency Counting (Characters and Integers)
- Other basic algorithmic problems

> ⚠️ These programs are for **learning and practice purposes**.  
> Some of them may contain bugs or incomplete features.

## 🛠 How to Compile

Use GCC to compile any file:

```
bash
gcc filename.c -o filename
./filename
```
